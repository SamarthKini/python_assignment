# Questions
1. Write a Python program that prompts the user to input their age. Store the age in a variable and then display a message stating the user's age in five years.

2. Create a program that takes two string inputs from the user, concatenates them, and then repeats the concatenated string five times.

3. Write a program that takes an integer input from the user. Check if the number is positive, negative, or zero and display the result.

4. Write a Python program that simulates a simple login system. It should prompt the user for a password and allow three attempts to enter the correct password before displaying a "locked out" message.

5. Define a function is_even(number) that returns True if a number is even and False if itâ€™s odd. Then write a program to take an integer input, call this function, and display whether the number is even or odd.

6. Write a program that repeatedly prompts the user to enter a number. If the user enters anything other than a number, display an error message and end the program.

7. Design a program that takes two integer inputs from the user and divides the first by the second. If the user enters zero as the second number, catch the exception and display an error message.

8. Implement a number-guessing game where the program randomly selects a number between 1 and 100. The user has seven attempts to guess the number. After each guess, the program should tell the user if the guess is too high, too low, or correct. Use functions to structure the program.

9. Write a program that accepts a list of numbers from the user, then displays the list in ascending order, descending order, and calculates the sum and average of the numbers.

10. Create a Magic 8 Ball program that stores several responses (e.g., "Yes," "No," "Maybe") in a list. When run, the program should display a random response from the list.

11. Ask the user to enter a sentence. Convert this sentence into a tuple of words, then displayeach word on a new line along with its position in the sentence.

12. Write a Python program to reverse a given string.

13. Write a Python function called count_vowels that takes a string as input and returns the count of vowels (a, e, i, o, u) in the string.

14. . Write a Python program to check whether a given string is a palindrome or not.

15. Write a Python function called calculate_circle_area that takes the radius of a circle as input and returns its area.

16. . Write a Python function called is_prime that takes an integer as input and returns True if the number is prime, otherwise False.

17. . Write a Python function called factorial that calculates the factorial of a given number recursively.
